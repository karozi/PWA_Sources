# ðŸ“š Source Lists for Product with Attitude

This repository collects **source lists for multiple articles** published on *Product with Attitude* by Karo Zieminski.  

Sometimes the full list of references doesnâ€™t fit into an email or Substack post, so this repo keeps everything in one transparent, easy-to-find place.

## ðŸ“‘ How Itâ€™s Organized
Each article has its own folder:

/sources  
  â”œâ”€â”€ /2025-09-21-ai-coding-lexicon  
  â”‚     â””â”€â”€ sources.md  
  â”œâ”€â”€ /2025-08-29-vibecoding-vs-spec  
  â”‚     â””â”€â”€ sources.md  
  â””â”€â”€ /2025-07-14-agentic-coding-experiments  
        â””â”€â”€ sources.md  


- `sources.md` â†’ plain list of links used in that article.  
- Folder names use `YYYY-MM-DD-title` format for clarity.

## âœ¨ Why This Matters

Publishing full source lists ensures:
	â€¢	Readers can verify claims directly.
	â€¢	Tools like NotebookLM (and similar research copilots) can ingest the complete list, making it easier to accelerate your research.

## ðŸ“Œ Usage
- Open the folder for the article youâ€™re interested in.  
- Each `sources.md` contains the full link list (one link per line).  
- Links are kept raw for portability â€” copy, restack, or integrate them into your own workflows.
